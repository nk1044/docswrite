##  Installation

### 1️ Install via npm

```sh
npm install trydivjs
```

### 2️ Getting Started

Upon installation, `trydivJS` automatically creates a `utils/` directory in your project root with a `script.js` file inside. This simplifies integration and component management.

####  Importing and Using Components

```javascript
// utils/script.js
import { DivUi } from "trydivjs";

const divUi = new DivUi();

// Load a UI component
divUi.GetComponent("your_component");
```

Replace `your_component` with the required component name, run your script, and let **trydivJS** do the rest!

####  Running the Script

To generate the component, execute:

```sh
node utils/script.js
```

This will create a new file **`your_component.txt`** inside the `utils/` folder, ready for use in your project.

####  Adding New Components

Simply add a new line to fetch additional components:

```javascript
// Fetch multiple components
divUi.GetComponent("Button01");
divUi.GetComponent("Navbar01");
divUi.GetComponent("Login01");
```
